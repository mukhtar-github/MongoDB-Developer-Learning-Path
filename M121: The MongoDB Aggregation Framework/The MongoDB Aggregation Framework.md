# The MongoDB Aggregation Framework

## Chapter 0: Introduction and Aggregation Concepts

### Introduction to the MongoDB Aggregation Framework

Hi, I'm Nathan. Welcome to *M121-the MongoDB Aggregation Framework*. I'll be one of your instructors for this course. Throughout this course, we're going to discuss the *aggregation framework, a key feature of MongoDB*. You'll learn about *expressive filtering, powerful data transformation, statistical utilities and data analysis*, and how to do much more work with a single operation.

This course is seven chapters long. With each chapter, there will be a new set of lesson videos. After most of these lessons, there will be a quiz to assess your learning of the material. At the end of each chapter, there will be a set of related lab exercises. Let's go over a few of the course logistics.

The target audience -- this is a beginner's course focused on developer practices. If you're coming from an operations background, fear not, young grasshopper, we have something for you too. It is expected that you are familiar with the *MongoDB query language*. If you aren't, we recommend you taking our definitive beginner course, *M001, before attempting M121*.

How does grading work?

There are quizzes, labs, and a final exam.

Quizzes are ungraded and exist to make sure that you're understanding the content.

Your grade in the class, however, will be based on how well you do on the labs and the final exam, each of these being worth 50% of your total grade.

Students with a grade of 65% or greater will receive a passing grade and will get a certificate of completion.

Finally, I'd highly encourage you to participate in the discussion forum.

We have knowledgeable teaching assistants who are there to answer your questions.

We also have your classmates who can also contribute to answering your questions and are often beneficial and knowledgeable resources.

The labs in this course can be challenging.

Based on our experience, we've seen that students who perform best in the course are those who are most active in the discussion forum.

By the end of this course, you should be familiar with how to transform data, perform data analysis, and reallocate work to the server from your client application.

With all of that said, we're excited to have you as a student in this course.

Best of luck.
