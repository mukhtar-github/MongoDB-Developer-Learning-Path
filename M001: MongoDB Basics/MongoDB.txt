To paste in the Vim Editor, use "+p then paste.
To create a new file vim (filename)
:wq or :x or ZZ - write (save) and quit

Long story short: If at all possible, use "*P or "+P to paste 
(which even works in some terminal emulators if I recall correctly).
This is the "correct" way to paste; everything else is basically a workaround gives you those kinds of headaches.

You can explore your current directory by hitting :Ex.
This will show a list view of your files and you can navigate up (j) or down (k) with the usual methods.
You can also delete a file by hitting: SHIFT + D and confirming with y.
To go back to editing, select the file and hit ENTER.

How do I delete a vim file in Terminal?
You can do it with two steps:
save as a new file. :w newfilename.
delete the old file. ! rm oldfilename.

! rm companies_dataset/companies.json
cat /var/m121/validateLab1.js
/var/mongodb/db/companies.json


If you want to select all of the text using Vim then use ggVGy (note the uppercase VG in the middle). This command moves
the cursor to the top of the file, enters visual mode, moves to the bottom of the file (thus, selecting all of the text)
and then yanks (copies) it. You can then use p to put (paste) this code but only inside of Vim.

If you want to copy to the clipboard to use somewhere outside of Vim then try this:
First, select everything using the commands outlined above but without the final y: (ggVG). Then press "*y or "+y. This should
now copy it to your operating system's clipboard and you can just paste (Ctrl/Cmd+v) anywhere you want outside of Vim.
This can vary depending on what settings you have for Vim but it should work.
:%y +

Or you can install jq which is faster (written in C) from your package manager
(e.g. sudo apt install jq in Ubuntu/Debian, and then in vim, type: (:%!jq .)

# M220JS: MongoDB for JavaScript Developers

> Learn the essentials of *Node.js* application development with *MongoDB*.

## Chapter 0: Introduction and Setup

> Course logistics, requirements for environment setup, and application architecture.

### Welcome To M220JS

Hello, and welcome to this course for *developing node JS applications with MongoDB*. My name is Matt, and I'll be one of your instructors. This course will focus on using *MongoDB's node JS driver* to develop applications that meet modern standards for performance and resilience. You may want to brush up on your *JavaScript*, because we jump right into application development.

In joining the course, you'll be placed into the role of a *back-end developer* on an application development team. The team is building a *movie browsing application called mflix*, and you'll be tasked with implementing the *database layer of the API*. You'll learn how to *create and share database connections, write data with different levels of durability, and handle errors you get back from the driver*.

But most importantly, you'll learn how to *develop an application with MongoDB* the right way. The homeworks are presented as *tickets*. And to complete the *tickets*, you'll need to read the *user story*, make sure the *unit tests* pass, and then run a full suite of integration tests on the *mflix application*.

The technology stack is composed of *node, Express, MongoDB, and React*. The *front end is written in react*, and is pre-built and bundled for you, so you'll be focused on the layer of the *back end* that talks directly to *MongoDB*. So thanks so much for joining us. And good luck on your path to becoming a *MongoDB developer*.

### MongoDB URI

In this lesson, we are going to the *MongoDB URI*. *URI* -- stands for *Uniform Resource Identifier*. It's going to look very similar to a *URL* which you are probably very familiar by browsing the internet. *URI's* are used to define the connections between *applications and MongoDB instances*. Applications can use *URI strings* to tell the driver the *host name and port* where *MongoDB* is running, the username and password used to log in, and any other connection options.

Basically anything about a connection to *MongoDB* can be defined in the *URI string* used to start the connection to the database.

```javascript
mongo "mongodb://cluster0-shard-00-00-jxeqq.mongodb.net:27017,cluster0-shard-00-01-jxeqq.mongodb.net:27017,cluster0-shard-00-02-jxeqq.mongodb.net:27017/aggregations?replicaSet=Cluster0-shard-0" --authenticationDatabase admin --ssl -u m121 -p aggregations --norc
```

This is a standard *URI string*. In other to use this *URI string*, we have to be explicit about the *host names* of each of the servers in our cluster, and if the *host name* of one of these servers changes, we have to update the *URI string* to account for it. In many courses, we'll be using a new kind of *URI string*, what we called an *SRV string*.

```javascript
mongodb+srv:<username>:<password>@<host>/<database>
```

The *SRV string* begins at this prefix -- mongodb+srv, that tells *MongoDB*, it's the address of the *SRV record*, we'll talk about that in a minute. The next portion is composed of authentication credentials, we separate the username and password with a colon, and then follow the password with an *@ sign*. After the *@ sign*, we specify the host, which is the *hostname* of the *SRV record* for the *MongoDB* cluster that we want to connect to. Note that, this *hostname* does not actually point to a database server, it only host the *SRV records*.

[![Screenshot-from-2021-11-22-08-40-04.png](https://i.postimg.cc/W43c2P9Y/Screenshot-from-2021-11-22-08-40-04.png)](https://postimg.cc/xXW4RBVL)

The *hostname* is the address of the file called *SRV record* or *service records*. The *service records*, will define it's own *DNS* with a list of *hostnames* we want to resolve to. So, even though we are connecting to cluster of servers, we don't need to know where each server in a cluster, because the *SRV record* keeps track of it for us. This is especially useful when the servers in our cluster change or rotate out because the *SRV record* will be updated to reflect this and we don't need to change anything in our client-side.

This part of the connection string -- *database*, is the *authentication database*. This is the *databse* in our cluster that contains the credentials of this *user -- username*. Essentialy, what we are saying is, I want to connect as this *user -- username* and the credentials to authenticate this user are stored in this *database*. Here's an example of a *URI string* an *SRV* format.

```javascript
mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@cluster0.dkemg.mongodb.net/admin?retryWrites=true
```

We've been specified our *username and password* at this point, then we're going to have a *hostname* of the *SRV record*, then the *database* that we want to authenticate against. If we want to specify any other option for the connection, we make this with this string -- we specify them at the end after the *question mark*. This option will retry by default if the connection error arises. So we set it to *retryWrites=true*.

To recap, in this lesson, we cover the structure of the *URI string*, and we briefly discuss the reason to use *SRV records*. The *URI string* is required to connect your applicaton to *MongoDB*. So make sure string is correctly formatted.

### Setting Up Atlas

In this lesson we'll walk through setting up a free Atlast account connecting a new free tier *MongoDB cluster* and importing the sample data that we'll use through out this course. We're Atlas because it is the easiest path for setting up a *MongoDB data store*. While you can complete this course using a local installation of *MongoDB*, we assume Atlas is being used through out.

### OVERVIEW

#### Overview

We are going to have series of README instructions to be able to setup our MFLIX application successfully. With MFLIX application, you will learn to create and share a database connection, perform the basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through the driver, handle errors, utilize the MongoDB best practices and more.

Mflix is composed of two main components:

* Frontend: All the UI functionality is already implemented for you, which includes the built-in React application that you do not need to worry about.
* Backend: The project that provides the necessary service to the application. The code flow is already implemented except some functions.
You'll only be implementing the functions which directly call to MongoDB.

#### Database Layer

We will be using MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB's official Database as a Service (DBaaS), so you will not need to manage the database component yourself. However, you will still need to install MongoDB locally to access the command line tools that interact with Atlas, to load data into MongoDB and potentially do some exploration of your database with the shell.

The following README sections are here to get you setup for this course.

### README: Setting Up mflix

#### Table of Contents

##### Setting Up mflix

* Project Structure
* Node Library Dependencies
* Running the Application
* Running the Unit Tests

In order to run properly, the MFlix software project has some installation requirements and environmental dependencies.

These requirements and dependencies are defined in this lesson, and they can also be found in the README.rst file from the mflix-js project, which you will download shortly. This lesson serves as a guide for setting up these necessary tools. After following this README, you should be able to successfully run the MFlix application. First, you will need to download the mflix-js project, as described below.

#### Download the mflix-js.zip file

You can download the mflix-js.zip file by clicking the link in the "Handouts" section of this page. Downloading this handout may take a few minutes. When the download is complete, unzip the file and cd into the project's root directory, mflix-js.

```javascript
cd ~/Downloads
unzip mflix-js.zip
cd mflix-js
```

Note: The handout contains some hidden files like .babelrc. Please ensure you copy the entire directory to a new location rather than selecting all files within your system's file browser to copy and paste into a new directory.

#### Project Structure

Most of your work will be implementing methods in the dao directory, which contains all database interfacing methods. The API will make calls to Data Access Objects (DAOs) that interact directly with MongoDB.

The unit tests in test will test these database access methods directly, without going through the API. The UI will run these methods in integration tests, and therefore requires the full application to be running.

The lesson handouts can be found in the test/lessons directory. These files will look like *lesson-name.spec.js*, and can be run with *npm test -t lesson-name*.

The API layer is fully implemented, as is the UI. The application is programmed to run on port 5000 by default - if you need to run on a port other than 5000, you can edit the dotenv_win (if on Windows) or the dotenv_unix file (if on Linux or Mac) in the root directory to modify the value of PORT.

Please do not modify the API layer in any way, under the mflix-js/src/api directory. This may result in the front-end application failing to validate some of the labs.

#### Node Library Dependencies

The dependencies for the MFlix application should be downloaded using the npm command-line tool. You can get this tool by downloading Node.js. Make sure to choose the correct option for your operating system.

Once the installation is complete, you may need to restart your computer before using the command line tools. You can test that it's installed by running the following command:

```javascript
node -v
```

This should print out the version of node you currently have - we recommend using version 10 or later, so this command should print something like v10.x.

Once npm is installed, you can install the MFlix dependencies by running the following command from the mflix-js directory:

```javascript
npm install
```

You must run this from the top level of the project, so npm has access to the package.json file where the dependencies are.

While running npm install, you might encounter the below error regarding node-gyp rebuild. Although, it is completely harmless and you can start the application by running npm start.

![m220js-npm-install-warning](https://s3.amazonaws.com/university-courses/m220/m220js-npm-install-warning.png)

#### Running the Application

In order for the application to use Atlas, you will need a file called .env to contain the connection information. In the mflix-js directory you can find two files, dotenv_unix (for Unix users) and dotenv_win (for Windows users).

Open the file for your chosen operating system and enter your Atlas SRV connection string as directed in the comment. This is the information the driver will use to connect. Make sure not to wrap your Atlas SRV connection between quotes:

```javascript
MFLIX_DB_URI = mongodb+srv://...
```

It's highly suggested you also change the SECRET_KEY to some very long, very random string. While this application is only meant for local use during this course, software has a strange habit of living a long time.

When you've edited the file, rename it to .env with the following command:

```javascript
mv dotenv_unix .env  # on Unix
ren dotenv_win .env  # on Windows
```

Note: Once you rename this file to .env, it will no longer be visible in Finder or File Explorer. However, it will be visible from Command Prompt or Terminal, so if you need to edit it again, you can open it from there:

```javascript
vi .env       # on Unix
notepad .env  # on Windows
```

In the mflix-js directory, run the following commands:

```javascript
# install MFlix dependencies
npm install

# start the MFlix application
npm start
```

This will start the application. You can then access the MFlix application at *localhost:5000*.

#### Running the Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for this course, you will use Jest. Jest has been included in this project's dependencies, so npm install should install everything you need.

Each course lab contains a module of unit tests that you can call individually with npm test from mflix-js directory like the following:

```javascript
npm test -t TICKET_TEST_NAME
```

Each ticket will contain the exact command to run that ticket's specific unit tests. You can run these commands from anywhere in the mflix-js project. Bear in mind that a tests will fail until the corresponding ticket is completed. For example to run the Connection Ticket test your shell command will be:

```javascript
npm test -t db-connection
```
