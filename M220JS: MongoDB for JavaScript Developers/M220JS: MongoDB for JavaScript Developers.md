### Welcome To M220JS

Hello, and welcome to this course for *developing node JS applications with MongoDB*. My name is Matt, and I'll be one of your instructors. This course will focus on using *MongoDB's node JS driver* to develop applications that meet modern standards for performance and resilience. You may want to brush up on your *JavaScript*, because we jump right into application development.

In joining the course, you'll be placed into the role of a *back-end developer* on an application development team. The team is building a *movie browsing application called mflix*, and you'll be tasked with implementing the *database layer of the API*. You'll learn how to *create and share database connections, write data with different levels of durability, and handle errors you get back from the driver*.

But most importantly, you'll learn how to *develop an application with MongoDB* the right way. The homeworks are presented as *tickets*. And to complete the *tickets*, you'll need to read the *user story*, make sure the *unit tests* pass, and then run a full suite of integration tests on the *mflix application*.

The technology stack is composed of *node, Express, MongoDB, and React*. The *front end is written in react*, and is pre-built and bundled for you, so you'll be focused on the layer of the *back end* that talks directly to *MongoDB*. So thanks so much for joining us. And good luck on your path to becoming a *MongoDB developer*.
